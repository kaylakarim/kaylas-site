    <h4>
        About the Book
    </h4>

    <div class="columntext">

        
        <p>Lara Jean Song Covey is a sixteen-year-old half-Korean American girl living in Virginia. She is extremely close to her older sister Margot and younger sister Kitty. Lara Jean keeps love letters to all the boys she has ever loved in a teal hatbox given to her by her late mother who died of a head injury when Lara Jean was just 9. There are 5 boys: Josh, her sister's boyfriend, a boy named Kenny from camp, Peter from 7th grade, Lucas from homecoming, and John Ambrose from model UN. Just before Margot leaves for university in Scotland, she breaks up with her boyfriend Josh Sanderson, who is also their next-door neighbor, and Lara Jean's friend. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>Lara Jean, who once had a crush on Josh, finds her feelings for him coming back after Margot leaves for school, and Josh admits during a conversation about crushes that his first serious crush was on Lara Jean.To cope with her feelings, Lara Jean writes a letter for Josh expressing her feelings. The letter she wrote when she was fourteen after Josh asked Margot out instead of her. Peter Kavinsky, one of the guys Lara Jean wrote a letter to, approaches her and tells her he does not have any sort of attraction to her. Lara Jean is confused but realizes he is referring to a letter she wrote him years ago after receiving it in the mail. Horrified, she tells him she wrote it a long time ago. </p>
        

    </div>




    <div class="columntext">

        <p>Lara Jean recounts what prompted her to write the letter: when she was in seventh grade, she and Peter were with a group of mutual friends when Peter kissed her. Lara Jean cannot find her hatbox at home. That night, she hears Josh come over and hides in a treehouse she used to spend a lot of time as a kid. The next morning at school, Josh asks her about the letter to him. She lies and says she no longer has feelings for him and that she is dating someone else. When he asks who it is, she says Peter as he's the first person she thinks of while he walks down the hallway. Lara Jean spontaneously jumps onto Peter and kisses him in front of Josh, and Peter kisses her back. </p>
        
        <p>At school, Lara Jean explains her situation to Peter, who decides to go along with the lie, as he has just broken up with his long-term girlfriend Genevieve (also Lara Jean's enemy) and wants a clean break. Lara Jean and Peter set up a list of ground rules for acting around each other. The more time they spend together, the more confused Lara Jean gets about her feelings. As Lara Jean and Peter begin to genuinely fall for each other, Josh becomes jealous of Peter, and when Lara Jean confronts him about it, he kisses her and tells her he wants to be with her, which makes Lara Jean realize that she no longer likes Josh and that she wants to date Peter for real.</p>

    </div>


    <div class="columntext">

        <p>On a school ski trip, Peter tells Lara Jean he does want to date her and they kiss in a hot tub. The following day, Genevieve tells her that there is a rumor that the two had sex in the hot tub, and Peter did not deny it. Humiliated, Lara Jean avoids Peter during Christmas break. Kitty invites him over to the Covey's recital party, which they had every year before their mother died. When Peter tries to talk to Lara Jean, Josh steps in to try and protect her, and Margot ends up hearing about how Josh and Lara Jean kissed. </p>
        
        <p>Margot and Lara Jean eventually reconcile, but Lara Jean remains angry at Peter until Kitty admits that she stole her sister's hatbox and mailed the letters to try and get back at Lara Jean for almost revealing Kitty's crush on Josh. Lara Jean forgives Kitty. Kitty tells Lara Jean that Peter really cares for her and returns the hatbox that is now filled with notes that Peter gave Lara Jean while they were fake-dating. Reading them over, Lara Jean has a change of heart and takes out her pen and paper to write a real love letter to Peter.</p>

    <h4>
        The Trilogy
    </h4>

    <div class="toptext">

        <p class ="width100">The novel is a trilogy, and includes two additional books, titled <span>P.S. I Still Love You</span> and <span>Always and Forever Lara Jean</span>. These books highlight the highs and lows of Lara Jean’s relationship with Peter, and also introduce another recipient of one of her letters, John Ambrose McLaren. </p>

    </div>

    <h5>
        P.s. I Still Love You
    </h5>

    <div class ="columntext">

        <p>In <span>P.S. I Still Love You</span>, we see the trial and error of Lara Jean’s first relationship. While the novel begins with a seemingly perfect relationship between Lara Jean and Peter, their relationship falters under the influences of Genevieve and John Ambrose McLaren, as well as the pressure of their feelings.</p>

        <p>Lara Jean is still navigating how to act in a relationship, and Peter is still in contact with Genevieve, which causes insecurities to grow within Lara Jean, and in a way, almost forcing her straight into John’s Arms. We see how the couple navigates through these influences, and eventually, the two work it out and their relationship is stronger than ever. </p>

    </div>

    <h5>
        Always and Forever Lara Jean
    </h5>

    <div class ="columntext">

        <p>In <span>Always and Forever Lara Jean</span>, again, Peter and Lara Jean’s relationship seems stronger than ever. And it is, until Lara Jean is rejected from the college that they planned to attend together. This brings out fear and insecurity in Lara Jean about her and Peter’s relationship, as she is scared that they won’t make it if they have to spend four years Long Distance.</p>

        <p> Because of this shame, Lara Jean keeps her college rejection from Peter. As Lara Jean navigates what she is going to do about the rejection, she ends up falling in love with another school, a school that’s far away from Peter. As the novel goes on, Peter finds out about both her rejection and her love for another school, and obviously, is mad at her. The two break up, and eventually get back together, realizing they love each other and wouldn’t let college get in the way </p>

    <h4>
        The Movie Adaptation
    </h4>

    <h5>
        Lead Roles
    </h5>

    <div id ="castimages">

        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/lara_jean.png">
        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/peter_k.png">
        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/kitty.png">
        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/margot.png">
        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/mrcovey.png">
        <img class="cast" src="images_p1/gen.png">

    </div>

    <p class="width100">The movie, like all book to movie adaptations, follows the plot of the book, but has some key differences:</p>

    <div class ="columntext">

        <h5 class="lesswidth">
            Missing Characters
        </h5>   

        <p class="lesswidth">In the book, the more notable character absence in the film is John Ambrose McClaren, who shows up a few times in the book, causing some tension between Lara Jean and Peter.</p>


        <h5 class="lesswidth">
                Location
        </h5>   

        <p class="lesswidth"> The books take place in Virginia, the movies in Oregon. But that means, when it comes to Lara Jean's college dreams, things are a bit different. In the film, she and Peter plan to go to Stanford together, in the books, their big plan is to attend UVA. </p>

    </div>

    <div class ="columntext">

        <h5 class="lesswidth">
            More Genevieve
        </h5>   
         
        <p class="lesswidth">The film focused a lot more on Lara Jean and Genevieve mending their relationship, which included Gen ending up at NYU with Lara Jean. Gen was simply less of a factor in the book.        </p>

            <h5 class="lesswidth">
                Peter's mom
            </h5>   

            <p class="lesswidth">In the book, Peter's mom played a big part in Lara Jean wondering if she and Peter should stay together in college after she essentially asks Lara Jean to break up with her son. </p>

    <h4>
        Why is it My Favorite Book?
    </h4>

    <div class="columntext">

        <p>I haven’t read the books in a while, but with the hype of Jenny Han’s second book to film adaptation of <span>The Summer I Turned Pretty</span>, it reminded me how much I enjoyed reading <span>To All The Boys I've Loved Before as a teenager.</span> I enjoyed it alot as a teenager, because I loved how hopelessly romantic Lara Jean was, and how she didn’t do anything about it.  </p>
        
        <p>She didn’t have many friends, but she had a really strong relationship with her sisters, which is exactly how I was in High School. I was scared to branch out and meet new people, and I mostly hung out with my sisters, that is until they both moved away for school (similar to Margot).</p>

    </div>

    <div class="columntext">

        <p> Because of this, it pushed me to go out and meet more people, and find a good support system, which is similar to what happens with Lara Jean. I feel like this book was the first time I really related exactly to what a character was feeling, and seeing how amazing her life turned out, it gave me hope. </p>
        
        <p>I also think the story is very playful and fun, I loved the idea of her writing love letters to all of her crushes. Nobody really writes love letters anymore, and I feel like the book and movie do a great job at intertwining the age of technology/social media, as well as the whimsy of old-fashion traditions in love. I haven’t really read a book like that, so it was refreshing.</p>

    </div>

        <p class="width100">Obviously, usually nothing is good as the first book in a trilogy, but I would say that Jenny Han does an amazing job at keeping the story flowing, and I genuinely enjoyed the progression of each book. </p>
