	<h1> Fundamentals of Web Design</h1>

<div class="paper" id="intro">
	
	<p>Web design has always been a dream profession of mine, but unforturnately, Fordham does not offer many classes on creative coding, and it has set me back on that goal. I enjoy graphic design and motion graphic design, and I feel like web design encapsulates both of those fields. I would also love to be a UX/UI designer, and knowing how to code is a major plus in that field of work. I am definitely interested in learning more about coding in the future.

	<p>Overall, I am satisfied with the work I produced for this class. I am excited to get started on a web design portfolio for potential employers, and I am also excited to potentially code my own portfolio. I feel like my work ranges from y2k, glittery style, to more polished works, and I believe that it is a good starting point for a future in this field. I feel like my favorite is definitely my To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before website. I had a lot more motivation and time at that point in the semester, and it was the one project that turned out exactly how I envisioned it.

	<p>This class has definitely changed my perspective on web design as a whole. I think the readings kind of made me realize that websites are dying, and straying from their original concepts. Viewing my classmates designs have also changed my perspectives on web design, since everyone has a completely different response to the same prompt. I feel like I have learned and taken inspiration from my classmates, and I love being in an environment where you can share and view other peoples works. I’ll miss that.
