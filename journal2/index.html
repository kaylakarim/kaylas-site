	<p>Technology has advanced so much since the internet was initially created, and because of this more jobs and opportunities to work in this field have appeared.</p>
	
	<p> However, working in technology is one of the most competitive fields in the world, and in order to enter such a densely populated field, one has to be creative and talented. One has to think outside of the box.

	<p class="paragraphCard">By thinking outside the box, we have effectively destroyed what the internet used to be. We have turned something as simple as a blog page or e-commerce site into a mind game, impossible to navigate through, with laggy animations all over the place. People have replaced usability with aesthetics.

	<p>We also see pages that are too boring, that lose the true essence of what the internet used to be. Something fun, fresh, and new.</p>
	
	<p> People found new ways of coding, and coded more creatively, and because of that, we lost the ways in which websites were originally created. </p>

	<p class="paragraphCard">I believe that this article was insightful, looking into the original ways of creating a site, and how different minds have thought up new ways of doing things. It reminds me of looking up how to add a specific HTML or CSS element while I am coding, and finding a blog post/thread where someone starts off with “You can’t technically do this in CSS but…” and gives a solution to your issue.

	<div class="topText" id="back">
	<p>I think when it comes to coding, I really want all of my elements to look perfectly aligned, and the original ratio/dimensions always look great, and once I try to make it responsive, I am dissatisfied with my original product. I think this article showed me that websites/coding languages were not built with the intention of catering to my heavily CSS-ed sites, and that is why I can never make everything look exactly how I want it. So the next time something isn’t exactly how I like it, I need to just remember that. </p>
