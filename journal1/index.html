        <h4> A Place I Can Store My Thoughts</h4>
        
        <p> not everything can be conveyed through a single design. the solution: a website. a place you can store your thoughts and share them with other people. somewhere people can learn more about your thoughts. somewhere that can be more descriptive, have animation and imagery. something that captivates one attention. </p>

        <h4>Will Websites Become Obselete?</h4>
